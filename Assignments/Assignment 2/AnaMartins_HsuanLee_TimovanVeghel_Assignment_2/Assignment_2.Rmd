In this project, we aim to find out if there is a way to predict IMDb movie ratings based on the [IMDb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset?select=title.akas.tsv). We aim to find which variables are relevant to the rating so we can create a prediction model which, hopefully, will let us know before anyone else which movies we should be going to the cinema for.

We start by getting our initial datasets:

```{r}
library(readr)
```

```{r}
name.basics <- read_tsv("name.basics.tsv/data.tsv")
```
