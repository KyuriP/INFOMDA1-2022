## Chapter 1: Preparing the data

### 1.1: Describing the data

For our dataset, we chose a [dataset from the International Civil
Aviation Organisation
(ICAO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcelotanis/air-accidents-from-jan2008-to-may2022-icao)
on all recorded aviation accidents between January 2008 and May 2022.
Aviation accidents are defined in the dataset as incidents which
resulted in serious damage, injury or even fatality. The dataset
contains 25 variables on a total of 6109 observations. A few of the more
important variables are: (a) number of fatalities in the accident, (b)
country where the accident occured, (c) the flight phase during which
the accident happened (e.g., landing, taxi, etc.), (d) the type of
aircraft involved and (e) the year of occurrence. Important to note also
is that the dataset suffers from missing data. The proportion of
missingness varies per variable, ranging from 77% (StateOfOperator) to
4% (Model).

```{r importing the data}
data<-read.csv(file="Data/ICAO_accidents.csv",header = T)
```

### 1.2: Organising the data and summary statistics

Before we start exploring the data, it is important to clean the dataset
up first. To start, we decided to remove the variables stated below due
to them either containing duplicate information (e.g., Date and Year) or
due to having information that we deemed too specific for our current
endeavour (e.g., the name of the operator of the aircraft).\
Variables: Location, Model, Registration, Operator, StateOfOperator,
StateOfRegistry, Class, ScheduledCommercial, TypeDesignator, Official,
OccCats Besides removing these variables, we also merged a few
combinations of variables. Firstly, the two weight variables (Over2250 &
Over5700) were merged to create one categorical weight variable
(WeightCat). Secondly, the two binary variables 'Airplane' and
'Helicopter' were merged to create one 'AircraftType' variable. Thirdly, we 
grouped 'Risk' variable into 'RiskCat' based on [ICAO Cathegory organizaton](https://www.icao.int/APAC/Meetings/2012_APRAST/OccurrenceCategoryDefinitions.pdf
). Please
note that beside these large changes small changes were also applied
(e.g., missing data classified as "Unknown/Undefined"). For a more
detailed view of the changes, see the comments between the code.\

  #fill NA with 'Unknown' tag
  mutate(RiskCat= replace_na(RiskCat, "Multiple"),
         WeightCat=replace_na(WeightCat,"Unknown") )%>% 
  #select variables of interest

levels(data$Risk)[1]<-"Unknown"
levels(data$FlightPhase)[1]<-"Unknown"
levels(data$InjuryLevel)[1]<-"Unknown"

str(data)
```

After these actions, the following variables were left to be used
further in our exploratory data analysis:

-   StateOfOccurrence: the country of occurrence

-   FlightPhase: the flight phase of occurrence (take off, landing,
    approach, etc.)

-   Fatalities: the number of fatal victims

-   WeightCat: a categorical aircraft basic operational weight
    (categories are: less than 2250KG, between 2250KG and 5700KG, over
    5700KG)

-   InjuryLevel: the level of injuries on people involved in the
    occurrence

-   AircraftType: whether the aircraft was an airplane or a helicopter
    Engine: the number of engines in the aircraft

-   EngineType: the aircraft engine type (categories are: jet, turboprop
    or piston)

-   Risk: the main risk type involved in the occurrence, coded according
    to High Risk Categories as used by the ICAO Year: the year of
    occurrence RiskCat: the main risk type involved in the occurence,
    coded according to High Risks Categories codes used by the ICAO

For an overview of the summary statistics of all categorical variables
per type of aircraft and a histogram of the continuous variable
Fatalities, see Table 1 and Figure 1 below.

```{r table 1}
data %>%
  ## Through CreateTableOne, we create a table that includes these variables
  CreateTableOne(vars = c("FlightPhase", "InjuryLevel","Engines", 
                          "Year", "EngineType",
                          "WeightCat"), 
                 ## we want all variables to be stratified by type of aircraft
                 strata = "AircraftType",
                 ## and we want engines and year to be noted as factor variables
                 factorVars = c("Engines", "Year"), data =  .,
                 ## it should not perform a t-test
                 test = FALSE) %>%

    caption =

  row_spec(c(1,2, 14, 15, 21, 27, 43, 48), bold = T, background = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(c(2:3), background = "white")

```

The distribution of number of fatalities was very skewed and consisted of 62% zeros (see Table 2), indicating no deaths during the accident. Additionally there was a large proportion (19%) of missing values. Among the fatal accidents, the number of deaths were most frequently between 1 and 25 (Figure 1) with median = 2. However, there are many individual accidents with the number of victims ranging from 25 to 300.

```{r}
#proportion of 0 fatalities and missing values
data %>% 
  subset(Fatalities==0 | is.na(data$Fatalities)) %>% 
  mutate(Fatalities= case_when(Fatalities==0 ~ "0",
                               is.na(Fatalities)~ "Missing"
                               )) %>% 
  group_by(Fatalities) %>%

            prop= round(n/nrow(data), digits=2))%>%
  kableone(., format = "html",

  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 300, by=50))

ggarrange(fat.notrans, fat.trans)
```



## Chapter 2: Exploratory data analysis

For our exploratory data analysis, we wanted to investigate the
following three questions:

1.  Does the number of accidents seem to change over time?

2.  During which flight phase do the most accidents seem to occur?

3.  What are the risk types associated with fatal and non-fatal
    accidents?

### 2.1: Accidents over time

To investigate the number of accidents over time, we created the
following plots that show the amount of accidents over time per type of
aircraft in different parameterizations of accident: (a) total death
count, (b) accident count and (c) fatal accident count.

```{r deaths over time plots,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 2"}
#death count per year- trend
data %>% filter(Fatalities >0) %>% group_by(Year,AircraftType) %>% 
  summarise(sum=sum(Fatalities)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=sum,color=AircraftType)) + 
  geom_line(size=1)  + scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")+
  labs(x = "Year", y="Number of deaths",color="Aircraft Type")+ ggtitle("The total death count over time")+theme_minimal()
```

```{r accidents over time plots,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 3"}
#number of accidents per year - trend
a<-data %>% group_by(Year,AircraftType) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=count,color=AircraftType)) + 
  geom_line(size=1) +  scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")+ggtitle("The accident count")+
  labs(x = "Year", y="Number of accidents")+theme_minimal()

#The fatal accidents per year-trend
c<-data %>% filter(Fatalities >0) %>% group_by(Year,AircraftType) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=count,color=AircraftType)) + 
  geom_line(size=1) +scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")+
  labs(x = "Year", y="")+ ggtitle("The fatal accident count")+theme_minimal()
ggarrange(a,c, common.legend = TRUE,legend = "bottom")
```

Figure 3 shows a large drop in the 
number of accidents after 2010. Hence, we wished to explore what might have 
caused this drop.

#### 2.1.1: Investigation of the drop between 2010 and 2012

What might have caused the drop in the number of accidents after 2010? 
We explored whether any of the other variables in the dataset might be able 
to explain the drop in the number of accidents through visual inspection of 
the plots below. 

```{r Engine Types used over time,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 4"}
data %>%subset(AircraftType=="Airplane" ) %>% group_by(Year,EngineType) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=count,color=EngineType)) + 
  geom_line(size=1) +scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  labs(x = "Year", y="Number of accidents",color="Engine Type")+ 
  ggtitle("The accident count depending on engine type of aircraft")+
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{r Number of engines in machines over time,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 5"}
data %>%subset(AircraftType=="Airplane" ) %>% group_by(Year,Engines) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=count,color=as.factor(Engines))) + 
  geom_line(size=1) +scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  labs(x = "Year", y="umber of accidents",color="Number of engines")+ 
  ggtitle("The accident count depending on the number of engines")+
  theme_minimal()
```
Figure 4 shows that for the type of engine, piston-type engines had 
the largest difference in the amount of accidents between 2010 and 2012. As for 
the number of engines, we find that single engine machines had the largest 
difference in the amount of accidents between 2010 and 2012 (see Figure 5). 

```{r third time plot,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 6"}
#filter AircraftType and Piston engine type specifically 
data %>%filter(AircraftType=="Airplane" , EngineType=="Piston") %>% 
  group_by(Year,Engines) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=count,color=as.factor(Engines))) + 
  geom_line(size=1) +scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  labs(x = "Year", y="Number of accidents",color="Number of Engines")+ 
  ggtitle("The Piston type of engine accident count")+
  theme_minimal() 
```

Combining the two plots in Figure 6, we indeed find that the largest difference in the 
amount of accidents is in single-piston engines. This could be indicative of 
perhaps an interaction effect between engine-type and number of engines on 
the number of accidents. 

```{r final 1,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 7"}
data %>% subset(Year %in% c("2010","2011","2012")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=FlightPhase, group=Year))+
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., fill = factor(..x..)), stat="count",width=0.8)+
  geom_text(aes( label = scales::percent(..prop..,accuracy = 0.1),
                   y= ..prop.. ), stat= "count", hjust = -0.3)+
  coord_flip()+my_theme1+
  ylim(c(0,0.45))+scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")+ facet_wrap(~Year)+ylab("Proportion")+xlab("")+
  ggtitle("Accidents in different flight phases (2010-2012)")
```

```{r final 2,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 8"}
data %>% subset(Year %in% c("2010","2011","2012")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=WeightCat, group=Year))+geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., 
                                                    fill = factor(..x..)), 
                                                stat="count",width=0.8)+
  ylim(c(0,0.67))+
  geom_text(aes( label = scales::percent(..prop..,accuracy = 0.1),
                   y= ..prop.. ), stat= "count", vjust = -.5) +my_theme1+
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8.4),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=10))+scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  facet_wrap(~Year)+ylab("Proportion")+xlab("Weight Category")+
  ggtitle("Weight cathegories of aircrafts participated in accidents (2010-2012)")
```

Figure 7 and 8 look at the relation between flightphase and weight categories 
respectively and the proportion of accidents per year. Figure 7 shows 
that the proportion of accidents per flightphase are quite consistent over the years. 
The latter plot, however, does show that in 2012, there was a much lower 
proportion of accidents in the lowest weight category, and a much higher 
proportion of accidents in the highest weight category compared to 2010 and 2011. 
This could be indicative that there were less issues with lower weight aircrafts 
and thus fewer accidents. However, important to note is that this could also be 
confounded by the number of flights per aircraft. Confirmatory research would be 
necessary for proper conclusions.

### 2.2: Exploring fatality

#### 2.2.1: How frequent are fatal accidents compared to the other Injury Level categories?

To investigate the fatality of aircraft accidents, we made the following plot (see Figure 9) 
which shows that one fifth of all aircraft accidents result in a fatal injury.

```{r Proportion of accidents that occured per injury level,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 9"}
#Proportion of accidents that occurred per injury level
data  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(InjuryLevel,
                  	c("Unknown", "None","Minor", "Serious",  "Fatal")),fill=InjuryLevel)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..count../sum(..count..)),
       	stat="count")+
  coord_flip()+
  ylim(0,0.4)+
  labs(title="Proportion of accidents that occured per injury level ", x =  
         "Injury Level", y="Proportion")+scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count../sum(..count..), accuracy = 0.1)),
        	stat= "count", size=3.5,hjust =-0.2 )+
  my_theme1

```

#### 2.2.2: Fatality by type of aircraft

We investigated fatality further by looking at the proportion of injury level 
per type of aircraft. Figure 10 shows that helicopters might be more fatal, as
there seems to be a large difference in the proportion of fatal injuries between 
airplanes and helicopters. 

```{r Proportion of accidents per injury level for airplanes and helicopters, fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 10"}
#Bar plot with proportion of accidents per injury level for airplanes and helicopters
data  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(InjuryLevel,
                  	c("Unknown", "None","Minor", "Serious",  "Fatal")),
         	group=AircraftType,
         	fill=AircraftType
         	)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..),
       	position = "dodge"
       	)+
  coord_flip()+scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")+
  labs(title="Proportion of accidents per injury level for airplanes and helicopters",
   	x= "Injury Level",
   	y="Proportion conditional on aircraft type")+
  scale_y_continuous( #display percentages in the bars
                	labels = scales::percent
                 	)+
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..prop.., accuracy = 0.1), y= ..prop..), 
            stat= "count", size=3, position = position_dodge(width = 1),
                        hjust =+1.3 )+my_theme
  

```

#### 2.2.3: Fatality by flight phase

Since we want to focus more on the differences between fatal and non-fatal accidents, 
from now on we categorise InjuryLevel as: Fatal, Non-Fatal 
(None, Minor, Serious combined) and Unknown. Then, we explored fatality in even more depth by looking at during which flight stages the most accidents occur proportionally per aircraft. The plot below, Figure 11, shows that for helicopters, most accidents tend to happen en route for both fatal and non-fatal accidents. Interesting to note is that for airplanes, fatal accidents also happen most often en route. Non-fatal accidents, however, seem to happen most often during the landing phase. \

```{r fatality plot three,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 11"}
#order of the FlightPhase factor with decreasing frequency of occurrence(for airplanes) 
FlightPhase.order.ap<-data %>%subset(AircraftType=="Airplane") %>%
  group_by(FlightPhase) %>%

                             	InjuryLevel=="Unknown" ~ "Unknown",
                             	InjuryLevel=="Fatal" ~ "Fatal"
                           	))

a<-data %>%subset(AircraftType=="Airplane") %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=factor(FlightPhase, FlightPhase.order.ap), group=InjuryLevel_3,
          	fill=InjuryLevel_3)) +

#### 2.2.4: Fatality and risk categories

Focusing on the main reasons for the aircraft accidents, we grouped `Risk` variable 
onto 12 categories and saved under `RiskCat` variable. 
In the Figure 12 we can see the main reason of non-fatal accidents involving airplanes and helicopters. The main cause of non-fatal accident for airplanes is connected to Runway safety hazards(accidents happening due to poor preparation of the runway), which is directly connected to Landing and Take-off flying phases and is in line with previous part of analysis. For helicopters the the mixture of at least 2 hazards coming from different categories listed in `RiskCat` is the cause of accidents.
Figure 13 represents risks involved in fatal accidents. It shows that the most frequent cause of catastrophes among airplanes are connected to Airborne hazards(accidents that happens in the flying phase).An example of this would be a air crush with other flying object.On the other hand, for helicopters causes classified under Airborne and Multiple categories are the major reasons for the accidents. We could conclude that among fatal accidents in general Airborne hazards are the main cause. Also helicopters' catastrophes more often involve several causes in comparison to the airplanes.
