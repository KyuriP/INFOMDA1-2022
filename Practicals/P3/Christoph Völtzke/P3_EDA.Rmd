  labs(title = "Predicted and observed distances")

# The predicted values are very similar to the observed
# values. However, they do not strictly follow the straight
# line because there is some modeling error: we use elastic1's
# model to predict elastic2's distance [error source 1] and
# we compare those predictions to elastic2's observed distance
# [error source 2].
